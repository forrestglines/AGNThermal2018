  abstract = {The brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the Abell 1664 cluster is 
unusually blue and is forming stars at a rate of \textasciitilde{} 23 M sun
yr-1. The BCG is located within 5 kpc of the X-ray peak,
where the cooling time of 3.5 \texttimes{} 108 yr and entropy of
10.4 keV cm2 are consistent with other star-forming BCGs in
cooling flow clusters. The center of A1664 has an elongated, "barlike"
X-ray structure whose mass is comparable to the mass of molecular
hydrogen, \textasciitilde{}1010 M sun in the BCG. We show that
this gas is unlikely to have been stripped from interloping galaxies.
The cooling rate in this region is roughly consistent with the star
formation rate, suggesting that the hot gas is condensing onto the BCG.
We use the scaling relations of B{\^\i}rzan et al. to show that the
active galactic nucleus (AGN) is underpowered compared to the central
X-ray cooling luminosity by roughly a factor of three. We suggest that
A1664 is experiencing rapid cooling and star formation during a low
state of an AGN feedback cycle that regulates the rates of cooling and
star formation. Modeling the emission as a single-temperature plasma, we
find that the metallicity peaks 100 kpc from the X-ray center, resulting
in a central metallicity dip. However, a multi-temperature cooling flow
model improves the fit to the X-ray emission and is able to recover the
expected, centrally peaked metallicity profile.},

  abstract = {We present radial entropy profiles of the intracluster medium (ICM) for 
a collection of 239 clusters taken from the Chandra X-ray Observatory's
Data Archive. Entropy is of great interest because it controls ICM
global properties and records the thermal history of a cluster. Entropy
is therefore a useful quantity for studying the effects of feedback on
the cluster environment and investigating any breakdown of cluster
self-similarity. We find that most ICM entropy profiles are well fitted
by a model which is a power law at large radii and approaches a constant
value at small radii: K(r) = K 0 + K 100(r/100
kpc)$\alpha$, where K 0 quantifies the typical
excess of core entropy above the best-fitting power law found at larger
radii. We also show that the K 0 distributions of both the
full archival sample and the primary Highest X-Ray Flux Galaxy Cluster
Sample of Reiprich (2001) are bimodal with a distinct gap between K
0 $\approx$ 30-50 keV cm2 and population peaks at K
0 \textasciitilde{} 15 keV cm2 and K 0 \textasciitilde{} 150 keV
cm2. The effects of point-spread function smearing and
angular resolution on best-fit K 0 values are investigated
using mock Chandra observations and degraded entropy profiles,
respectively. We find that neither of these effects is sufficient to
explain the entropy-profile flattening we measure at small radii. The
influence of profile curvature and number of radial bins on best-fit K
0 is also considered, and we find no indication that K
0 is significantly impacted by either. For completeness, we
include previously unpublished optical spectroscopy of H$\alpha$ and [N
II] emission lines discussed in Cavagnolo et al. (2008a). All data and
results associated with this work are publicly available via the project

  abstract = {Numerical simulations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) feedback in 
cool-core galaxy clusters have successfully avoided classical cooling
flows, but often produce too much cold gas. We perform adaptive mesh
simulations that include momentum-driven AGN feedback, self-gravity,
star formation, and stellar feedback, focusing on the interplay between
cooling, AGN heating, and star formation in an isolated cool-core
cluster. Cold clumps triggered by AGN jets and turbulence form
filamentary structures tens of kpc long. This cold gas feeds both star
formation and the supermassive black hole (SMBH), triggering an AGN
outburst that increases the entropy of the intracluster medium (ICM) and
reduces its cooling rate. Within 1-2 Gyr, star formation
completely consumes the cold gas, leading to a brief shutoff of the AGN.
The ICM quickly cools and redevelops multiphase gas, followed by another
cycle of star formation/AGN outburst. Within 6.5 Gyr, we observe three
such cycles. There is good agreement between our simulated cluster and
the observations of cool-core clusters. ICM cooling is dynamically
balanced by AGN heating, and a cool-core appearance is preserved. The
minimum cooling time to free-fall time ratio typically varies between a
few and $\greaterequivlnt$ 20. The star formation rate (SFR) covers a wide range,
from 0 to a few hundred \{M\}$\odot$ \{\{yr\}\}-1, with
an average of \texttildelow{} 40 \{M\}$\odot$ \{\{yr\}\}-1. The
instantaneous SMBH accretion rate shows large variations on short
timescales, but the average value correlates well with the SFR.
Simulations without stellar feedback or self-gravity produce
qualitatively similar results, but a lower SMBH feedback efficiency
(0.1\% compared to 1\%) results in too many stars.},

  abstract = {We provide an analytic framework for interpreting observations of multiphase circumgalactic gas that is heavily informed by recent numerical simulations of thermal instability and precipitation in cool-core galaxy clusters. We start by considering the local conditions required for the formation of multiphase gas via two different modes: (1) uplift of ambient gas by galactic outflows, and (2) condensation in a stratified stationary medium in which thermal balance is explicitly maintained. Analytic exploration of these two modes provides insights into the relationships between the local ratio of the cooling and freefall timescales (I.e., \{t\}\{cool\}/\{t\}\{ff\}), the large-scale gradient of specific entropy, and the development of precipitation and multiphase media in circumgalactic gas. We then use these analytic findings to interpret recent simulations of
circumgalactic gas in which global thermal balance is maintained. We show that long-lasting configurations of gas with 5$\lessequivlnt$ $\backslash$min
(\{t\}\{cool\}/\{t\}\{ff\})$\lessequivlnt$ 20 and radial entropy profiles similar to observations of cool cores in galaxy clusters are a natural outcome of precipitation-regulated feedback. We conclude with some observational predictions that follow from these models. This work focuses primarily on precipitation and AGN feedback in galaxy-cluster cores, because that is where the observations of multiphase gas around galaxies are most complete. However, many of the physical principles that govern condensation in those environments apply to circumgalactic gas around galaxies of all masses.},

  abstract = {To better constrain models of cool core galaxy cluster formation, we 
have used X-ray observations taken from the Chandra and ROSAT archives
to examine the properties of cool core and noncool core clusters,
especially beyond the cluster cores. Using an optimized reduction
process, we produced X-ray images, surface brightness profiles, and
hardness ratio maps of 30 nearby rich Abell clusters (17 cool cores and
13 noncool cores). We show that the use of double $\beta$ models with
cool core surface brightness profiles and single $\beta$ models for
noncool core profiles yield statistically significant differences in the
slopes (i.e., $\beta$ values) of the outer surface brightness profiles,
but similar cluster core radii, for the two types of clusters. Hardness
ratio profiles as well as spectroscopically fit temperatures suggest
that noncool core clusters are warmer than cool core clusters of
comparable mass beyond the cluster cores. We compared the properties of
these clusters with the results from analogously reduced simulations of
88 numerical clusters created by the adaptive mesh refinement Enzo code.
The simulated surface brightness profiles have steeper $\beta$-model fits
in the outer cluster regions for both cool cores and noncool cores,
suggesting additional intracluster medium (ICM) heating is required
compared to observed cluster ICMs. Temperature and surface brightness
profiles reveal that the simulated clusters are overcooled in their
cores. As in the observations, however, simulated hardness ratio and
temperature profiles indicate that noncool core clusters are warmer than
cool core clusters of comparable mass far beyond the cluster cores. The
general similarities between observations and simulations support a
model described in Paper I suggesting that noncool core clusters
suffered early major mergers destroying nascent cool cores. Differences
between simulations and observations will be used to motivate new
approaches to feedback in subsequent numerical models.},
