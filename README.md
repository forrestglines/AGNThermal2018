First draft of the paper. Lacking some references, but probably won't change
much beyond that.

code is in the source_code_and_other_files directory. The code base is a little
large, and is still changing, so there's not a good reason to copy it here yet.

I am still working on the code tomorrow Monday, since it's currently
in between working states. If the code starts working, I will change the
results section of the report.
